\section{Fitzgerald}
The Fitzgerald was invented by Dale Degroff in the 1990s. Starting in the early 90s at the Rainbow Room,
New York, Mr DeGroff was instrumental in the revival and expansion of the American bar scene.
His advocacy for using fresh juices in drinks helped revitalise bars into using fresh ingredients instead of bottled sweetened juices.
